# Awesome On-Device LLM papers
A curated and up-to-date paper list of awesome on-deivce Large Language Models (LLMs) / Small Language Models (SLMs) research.

*When the AGI era comes, the role of on-device LLMs / SLMs will likely become increasingly critical. They offer unique advantages in terms of privacy, responsiveness, and user-centric customization that cloud-based models may not be able to match. However, LLMs are often large and resource-intensive, making it difficult to deploy them on devices with limited computational power and memory. Researching techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and distillation can lead to more efficient models as SLMs that retain performance while being lightweight enough for mobile devices. This can enable a wider range of applications and improve accessibility.*
